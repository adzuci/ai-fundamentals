    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces **Deep Learning for classification** using a simple neural network to predict whether a student will **pass** or **fail** based on study hours and attendance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the house price notebook (regression), this is a **binary classification** task: the model outputs a probability and we interpret it as Pass (1) or Fail (0).\n",

    "**Objective**: Build a simple neural network that predicts whether a student will pass or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model type**: Neural Network (deep learning / supervised learning – classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea**: The network learns patterns from two features (study hours and attendance). The output layer uses **sigmoid** activation to produce a probability between 0 and 1; we treat values above 0.5 as Pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow a step-by-step workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install/import libraries\n",
    "2. Create dataset\n",
