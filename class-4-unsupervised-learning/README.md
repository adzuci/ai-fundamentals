## Class 4 – Unsupervised Learning (K‑Means demo)

This folder contains the starting point for **Class 4: Unsupervised Learning**, beginning with a hands‑on **K‑Means clustering** example.

- `unsupervised_kmeans_demo.pdf` — slide deck that walks through:
  - The motivation for unsupervised learning and clustering.
  - A customer‑segmentation example using **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.
  - Step‑by‑step K‑Means workflow in Python (install, imports, dataset, fitting, and visualization).

Future updates to this folder will add:

- A Jupyter notebook (`01_class_4_kmeans_basics.ipynb`) mirroring the PDF demo.
- Additional unsupervised algorithms (e.g., hierarchical clustering, dimensionality reduction) that follow the same step‑by‑step pattern used in Class 2 and Class 3.
