# Class 3 – Machine Learning Basics & Deep Learning Basics

This class builds directly on **Class 2 – Machine Learning Basics**. In Class 2 you prepared data for modeling (DataFrames, missing values, categorical encoding, scaling, and train/test splits). Class 3 assumes you are comfortable with those ideas and focuses on **training and evaluating models**, including a first look at **deep learning**.

## How this extends Class 2

- Reuses the same ideas and patterns from `class-2-machine-learning-basics/` (especially `data-preprocessing.ipynb` and `scaling-data.ipynb`).
- Moves from “ready-for-ML features” to “train and evaluate simple models”.
- Introduces common supervised learning workflows end‑to‑end using the same **common step structure**:
  1. Define the objective
  2. Install/import libraries
  3. Load or create a dataset
  4. Separate features and target
  5. Train/test split
  6. Train model
  7. Make predictions
  8. Evaluate model
  9. (Optional) Visualize and iterate
- Adds a gentle introduction to **deep learning basics** (e.g., simple feed‑forward networks) on top of the same pipeline.

## Status

- This folder is a **starting point** for Class 3 materials.
- Notebooks and code will be added here; for now, use Class 2 in `class-2-machine-learning-basics/` if you want to see the full preprocessing pipeline.
