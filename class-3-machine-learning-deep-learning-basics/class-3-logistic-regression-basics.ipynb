    "We’ll mirror the steps from the *Logistic_Regression_demo1* slides using a tiny example. If you have not already walked through the **Class 3 Linear Regression** notebook (`class-3-linear-regression-basics.ipynb`), start there first – the pattern is the same, just with a regression target instead of a classification label.\n",

    "- **Objective**: Predict whether a student **passes or fails** based on **study hours**.\n",
    "- **Model type**: Logistic Regression (binary classification).\n",
    "- **Key idea**: The model outputs a **probability between 0 and 1**, then we turn that into a class (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass).\n",

    "We’ll follow the same 10‑step supervised‑learning pattern you saw in Class 3:\n",
