# Class 8 – Bias and Ethics in AI/ML

This class introduces **bias and ethics** in AI and machine learning: how models can reflect and amplify societal biases, and how to think critically about responsible AI development and deployment.

## How this fits the course

Classes 2–7 focused on **data**, **modeling**, **NLP**, and **Computer Vision**. Class 8 steps back to consider the **human and societal impact** of these systems:

- Types of bias in data and algorithms
- Fairness metrics and trade-offs
- Ethical frameworks for AI development
- Responsible AI practices

| Topic | What you get |
|-------|----------------|
| **Bias overview** | Data bias, algorithmic bias, and their real-world consequences. |
| **Fairness concepts** | Different definitions of fairness and why they can conflict. |
| **Practices** | Ways to detect, measure, and mitigate bias. |
| **Hands-on** | Notebook with exercises to explore bias in a simple classifier. |

**Start here:** Use `01_class_8_bias_and_ethics_basics.ipynb` as your entry point. Content will be expanded as materials are added.
