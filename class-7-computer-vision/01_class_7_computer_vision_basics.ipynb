    "# Class 7 Notebook – Computer Vision (CV) Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces **Computer Vision (CV)** using images and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision enables machines to \"see\"—interpreting images and video for tasks like:\n",
    "- **Image classification** – What is in this image? (e.g., cat, dog, airplane)\n",
    "- **Object detection** – Where are objects in the image?\n",
    "- **Image segmentation** – Which pixels belong to which object?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Set up the environment and prepare for hands-on image processing and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key ideas**:\n",
    "- Images are represented as arrays of pixels (height × width × channels)\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn spatial features from images\n",
    "- Transfer learning reuses pre-trained models for faster training\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the first code cell to confirm your environment works."

    "## What is Computer Vision?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer Vision** is a field of Computer Science that enables machines to intelligently analyze visual data. The technology mimics the human brain by using pattern recognition on massive amounts of visual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key real-world applications** include self-driving cars, facial recognition, and various healthcare uses. Computer Vision is currently used in retail for automatic checkout and for traffic rule enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges** include the complexity of human vision and technical hurdles like poor data quality."
